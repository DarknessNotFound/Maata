## Government System: The Communal Forge
The Order of Lahakhshil operates under a communal system based on the teachings of the great dwarf Marl Raxc.

- **Shared Resources:** No member owns their own forge; all workspaces are communal.
- **Collective Decision-Making:** Major decisions are made by the Crimson Sashes in open council, with input from all ranks. Each member has a voice, regardless of status.
- **Rotating Leadership:** Leadership roles rotate among the Crimson Sashes to prevent consolidation of power and encourage fresh perspectives.
- **Merit-Based Advancement:** Progress through the ranks is determined by skill, contribution to the guild, and peer recognition.
- **Support for All:** The guild provides food, shelter, and training for every member, ensuring no one is left behind. However, one must pay membership dues for these services.
- **Membership Dues:** The guild needs funds to operate. The dues are only 20% of revenue.

## Rituals & Practices
- **The First Flame:** New members light their first forge under supervision, symbolizing their entry into the communal fire.
- **The Shared Hammer:** A ceremonial hammer is passed between members during council meetings, representing unity and shared purpose.
- **Forge Festivals:** Seasonal gatherings where members collaborate on grand projects, celebrate achievements, and honor Lahakhshil.


## Beliefs
- The perfection of the weapon is a reflection of the perfection of the soul.
- Individual achievement is celebrated only when it uplifts the whole guild.
- Lahakhshil blesses those who work together and share their knowledge freely.

## Notable Figures
