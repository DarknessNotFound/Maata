# Athion

*Capital: Athion*

## Description

Athion lies along the eastern coastline, where fertile soil meets the crashing waves of the sea. Once a small port city under the Ilthunia League, Athion grew rapidly thanks to its rich farmland and thriving whaling industry. The city’s bustling docks are lined with ships, and its markets overflow with goods from both land and sea. Athion’s people are known for their independence and resilience, shaped by centuries of struggle and self-reliance.

Two centuries ago, Athion broke away from Ilthunia, rebelling against Muscoda’s rule. The war that followed was bloody and hard-fought, leaving deep scars on both sides. Today, Athion stands as a proud, self-governing nation, honoring the memory of those who sacrificed for freedom with annual remembrance ceremonies. Though relations with Ilthunia remain tense, Athion continues to prosper, its citizens fiercely protective of their autonomy of their autonomy and heritage.

Similar to the Ilthunia League, Athion is mainly composed of fair skinned humans. However, Athion are very protective of their culture leading to a highly restrictive immigration process. The only diversity you'll see are the sailors from other countries looking to trade.

## Country Relations

The Athion maintains tense relations to the Griston League to the south. While they do share a common ancestry and culture, Griston League took Ilthunia's side in the war and Athions aren't know for forgiveness. 

The Athions maintain tense relations with the [Ilthunia League](ilthunia-league.html). Many Athions are weary of Ilthunia and aware of the sacrafices made for their independence. The Athion pride won't let them be ruled by another city ever again.

The Norena Kingdom to the north currently maintains unstable relations with Ilthunians. Since Norena composes of mainly dwarves, many citizens remember the bloody war and don't want much to do with Athions.
